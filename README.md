# garrettleber.com - Frontend

This repo holds the frontend code for my personal website, created as part of the cloud resume challenge located at https://cloudresumechallenge.dev

I chose to use a template for the website found at w3schools.com.

I crafted the javascript counter myself using a fetch request to the API built by the backend.

I used AWS CodePipeline to automatically deploy updates to this repo to the live S3 bucket hosting the site.
